# STL to 2d desmos
This repo projects a 3d mesh into a defined 2d screen, and makes the lines exportable for Desmos (2d). 
### Running
- Install trimesh, numpy, and matpotlib. 
- Define your parameters (stl path and mesh rotation) in stl_to_desmos.py
- Run stl_to_desmos.py
- Copy desmos_output.txt into desmos. 
I highly recommend using stl models that are low poly. Otherwise, your desmos will lag out and will cut off part of your ouptut, essentially leaving out a random amount of detail.
